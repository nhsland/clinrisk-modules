# Clinrisk Open Source Modules

ClinRisk specialises in medical software to implement risk prediction algorithms for use in clinical care.    

ClinRisk is best known for its implementation of the QRISK®2 heart disease algorithm, now used in over 95% of UK GP surgeries, ClinRisk is also responsible for other risk scores, including QDiabetes®, QKidney®, QFracture®, QCancer® and QStatin®, which give individualised patient risk of type 2 diabetes, kidney failure, hip and other osteoporotic fracture, an undiagnosed cancer, and the risk/benefit profile of taking statins respectively. The science behind each algorithm is published in peer reviewed journals and the implementation of the heart of the algorithms are published as open source software under either the GNU Lesser General Public Licence or the GNU Affero General Public Licence. This is for transparency, to help wide accessibility and to stimulate further research.
