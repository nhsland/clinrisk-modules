Additional disclaimer of warranty.

Our intention in releasing this code is to enable others to implement the sbpPredictor algorithm faithfully.
However, the nature of the GNU Lesser General Public License is such that we cannot prevent others altering the value of the coefficients if they should so wish, thus, in effect, actually creating a different algorithm which has not been subject to scrutiny and peer review, and is no longer sbpPredictor.
We stress, therefore, that it is the responsibility of the end user to check that the source that they receive produces the same results as the original code posted at http://svn.clinrisk.co.uk/opensource/sbpPredictor.
Inaccurate implementations of risk scores can lead to wrong patients being given the wrong treatment.
